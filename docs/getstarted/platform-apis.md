## Platform APIs

The __Platform Level APIs__ give you the power to create Instances, retrieve OAuth Information, create Accounts and more.

The required Platform Level APIs are Instances and Elements. These APIs are used to create Element Instances and retrieve OAuth Information if applicable.

You can find the Platform APIs in the console in the API DOCS section of the menu.

`/instances` __(Required)__: A connection between Cloud Elements Service and an endpoint (eg Dropbox, Salesforce). The Instances APIs are used to authenticate, provision and manage Elements.

`/organization `__(Optional)__: The top level entity such as your company. A default account and admin user is assigned to your organization. The Organization APIs are used to manage users within an organization.

`/accounts` __(Optional)__: A subset of an organization. Accounts can be your customers, partners, divisions, environments, or any entity associated with your organization. Accounts APIs access and manage all of the accounts associated with your organization. You can also manage users associated with Accounts.

`/users `__(Optional)__: the entity that identifies the unique end user in Cloud Elementsâ€™ system. The Users APIs allow you to manage users associated with Organizations, Accounts or Instances. Users can only be created using the default Organization or Account Resource.
